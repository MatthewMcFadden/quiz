# QUIZ
## Quiz Information
As a coding boot camp student I have created a timed quiz using JavaScript fundamentals that store high scores
so that I can gauge my progress. Using separate HTML/JavaScript/CSS files I have created multiple pages that function
well. When I click the start button a timer starts and I am presented with a question when I answer a question I am presented with another question. When I answer correctly or incorrectly (green, red) the box will change a color giving
me feedback. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over. When the game is over I can save my initials and score.
